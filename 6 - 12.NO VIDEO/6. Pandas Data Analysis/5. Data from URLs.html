<p>In some of the lectures, you'll notice <code>.csv</code> files being imported from file using something like:</p><p><code>heart_disease = pd.read_csv("data/heart-disease.csv")</code></p><p>This is helpful if you have the data downloaded to your computer or in the same directory as your notebook.</p><p>But if you don't, another great feature of pandas is being able to import <code>.csv</code> files directly from a URL.</p><p>For example, for the <code>heart-disease.csv</code> file, using the <code>read_csv()</code> function you can directly import it using the URL <a href="https://github.com/mrdbourke/zero-to-mastery-ml" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">from the course GitHub repo</a>:</p><p><code>heart_disease = pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrdbourke/zero-to-mastery-ml/master/data/heart-disease.csv")</code></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> If you're using a link from GitHub, make sure it's in the "raw" format, by clicking the raw button.</p><figure><img src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2020-01-16_11-39-42-0a18c48de4cf7e21768e941b440a5289.png"></figure>
