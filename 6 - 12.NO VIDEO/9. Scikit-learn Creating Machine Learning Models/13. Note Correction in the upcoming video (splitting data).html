<h4>Correction to filling data with Scikit-Learn</h4><p>The next video contains techniques to deal with missing data and turning categorical (non-numerical) data into numbers using Scikit-Learn.</p><p>All of the code in the video is correct, however, there is one improvement which should be noted.</p><p>In a nutshell, the video shows&nbsp;filling&nbsp;and&nbsp;transforming&nbsp;the&nbsp;entire&nbsp;dataset (<code>X</code>) and&nbsp;although&nbsp;the code works and runs,&nbsp;it's&nbsp;best&nbsp;to&nbsp;fill&nbsp;and&nbsp;transform&nbsp;training&nbsp;and&nbsp;test&nbsp;sets&nbsp;separately. </p><p>I've fixed the code on GitHub for both notebooks (all previous links to these notebooks will work) to reflect this as well as created an end-to-end Colab notebook to reflect the change:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://github.com/mrdbourke/zero-to-mastery-ml/blob/master/section-2-data-science-and-ml-tools/introduction-to-scikit-learn.ipynb" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">introduction-to-scikit-learn.ipynb</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://github.com/mrdbourke/zero-to-mastery-ml/blob/master/section-2-data-science-and-ml-tools/introduction-to-scikit-learn-video.ipynb" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">introduction-to-scikit-learn-video.ipynb</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/162DyoCBFeufMjJI7n4XCiYpdqIdktZw_" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Full example in Google Colab (this will work straight away)</a></p></li></ul><p>The main takeaways:</p><ul><li><p>Split your data first (into train/test), always keep your training &amp; test data separate</p></li><li><p>Fill/transform the training set and test sets separately (this goes for filling data with pandas as well)</p></li><li><p>Don't use data from the future (test set) to fill data from the past (training set)</p></li></ul><p>Keep these in mind when you watch the upcoming video, and remember, full working code is available in the links above.</p><p>Thank you Robert <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-machine-learning-and-data-science-zero-to-mastery/learn/#questions/9506426" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">for pointing this out</a> on the QA forums.</p>
