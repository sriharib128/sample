<p>In the previous few videos we worked on filling the missing data in the training and validation data before splitting it into training and validation sets using the following code:</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums"># Split data into training and validation
df_val = df_tmp[df_tmp.saleYear == 2012]
df_train = df_tmp[df_tmp.saleYear != 2012]</pre><p>The code worked but how might this interfere with our model?</p><p>Remember the goal of machine learning: use the past to predict the future.</p><p>So if our validation set is supposed to be representative of the future and we’re filling our training data using information from the validation set, what might this mean for our model?</p><p>The challenge here comes in two parts.</p><ol><li><p>What does it mean if we fill our training data with information from the future (validation set)?</p></li><li><p>How might you implement a fix to the current way things are being done in the project?</p></li></ol><p>If you need a hint, remember some takeaways from a previous lecture:</p><ul><li><p>Split your data first (into train/test), always keep your training &amp; test data separate</p></li><li><p>Fill/transform the training set and test sets separately (this goes for filling data with pandas as well)</p></li><li><p>Don’t use data from the future (test set) to fill data from the past (training set)</p></li></ul><p>Keep these things in mind when we create a data preprocessing function in a few videos time, they'll help you answer the question which gets raised then too.</p>
