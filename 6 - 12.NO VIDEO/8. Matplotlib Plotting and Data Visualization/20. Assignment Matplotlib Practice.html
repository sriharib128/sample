<p>In this assignment, you'll get hands-on with a notebook which has a series of exercises based on the Matplotlib code and concepts we went through in the previous videos.</p><p>Download the Matplotlib exercises and solutions notebooks from GitHub and work through each cell in the exercises notebook using what you've learned in the previous videos.</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://github.com/mrdbourke/zero-to-mastery-ml/blob/master/section-2-data-science-and-ml-tools/matplotlib-exercises.ipynb" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Matplotlib Exercises notebook</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://github.com/mrdbourke/zero-to-mastery-ml/blob/master/section-2-data-science-and-ml-tools/matplotlib-exercises-solutions.ipynb" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Matplotlib Exercises Solutions notebook</a> (avoid looking at this for as long as possible)</p></li></ul><p>Don't forget, if you get stuck, there's plenty of help available!</p><p>Remember, you should always try to run the code yourself first.</p><p>If you're still stuck feel free to ask the Discord server (Checkout the <strong>#machinelearning-datascience </strong>channel for help) or search the internet for answers. </p><p><strong>Note:</strong> In the notebook, there may be instructions to import a file from a file path such as <code>"../data/car-sales.csv"</code>, you should change these to wherever you're storing <code>"car-sales.csv"</code>. Or the direct link on GitHub (in raw format), such as, <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrdbourke/zero-to-mastery-ml/master/data/car-sales.csv" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrdbourke/zero-to-mastery-ml/master/data/car-sales.csv</code></a>.</p><p>After working through the Matplotlib exercises notebook, how did you go?</p><p>Again, whether you blazed through them all or got stuck multiple times and had to look at the documentation or go back to the lectures, it's all part of the process.</p><p>Practising different exercises and writing code on your own is the best way to practice different concepts.</p>
