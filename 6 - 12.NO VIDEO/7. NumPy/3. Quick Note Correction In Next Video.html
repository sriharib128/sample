<p>Hey everyone!</p><p>Just a quick note for the next couple of lectures which mention/show the&nbsp;"Anatomy of a NumPy Array" slide.</p><p>The code and concepts in the lectures are all correct, however, the slide displays the wrong array for the 3-dimensional array (you'll see these in the upcoming videos).</p><p>The correct slide should be:</p><figure><img src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2020-01-28_03-56-32-433698fdb6cb595d61a490062cd00619.png"></figure><p>The main difference is the bottom left array. In the videos it's displayed incorrectly.</p><p>If you'd like to get the same array as the "Anatomy of a NumPy Array" slide shows in the following videos, run the following code:</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums"># Same array as slide in video
a3 = np.array([[[1, 2, 3],
                [4, 5, 6]],
               [[7, 8, 9],
                [10, 11, 12]],
               [[13, 14, 15],
                [16, 17, 18]]])</pre><p>And just another reminder, figuring out the different shapes of arrays can be a bit of a challenge!&nbsp;It takes a fair bit of practice to get used to them.</p><p>Feel free to leave a question if you need a hand with anything.</p><p>A big thank you to @WoWi for pointing out the mistake.</p><p>- Daniel</p>
