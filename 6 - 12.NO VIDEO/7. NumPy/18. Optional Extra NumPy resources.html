<p>Woah! You've covered a lot on NumPy. And that's why these extra resources are optional. You can think of them as supplements to what we've covered so far.</p><p>I learn best when I look at similar things from different angles.</p><p>In this case, that's what these extra resources on NumPy provide. A look at the material we've covered from different points of view.</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/02.02-the-basics-of-numpy-arrays.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Basics of NumPy Arrays by Jake VanderPlas</a></p></li><li><p><a href="http://jalammar.github.io/visual-numpy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">A Visual Introduction to NumPy by Jay Alammar</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://numpy.org/doc/1.17/user/quickstart.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NumPy Quickstart tutorial (part of the NumPy documentation)</a></p></li></ul><p>As always, remember the best way to learn a new coding concept is to write it yourself.
